# Network Security Test Scope: DVWA

## Objective
The primary objective of this network security test is to assess the security of the Damn Vulnerable Web Application (DVWA) with a specific focus on TCP/IP and UDP communication protocols. The assessment aims to identify and address potential vulnerabilities in the network infrastructure supporting DVWA.

## Scope Inclusions

### Target System
- **Application Under Test:** Damn Vulnerable Web Application (DVWA)
  - **Version:** 1.0.7
  - **Deployment:** [Specify deployment details, e.g., hosted on Apache server, running on Linux]

### Network Components
The assessment will cover the security of the following network components related to DVWA:
- **Firewall:** Inspect the configuration and rules governing TCP/IP and UDP traffic.
- **Router:** Assess the routing policies and controls in place.
- **Switches:** Evaluate the security of network switches handling DVWA traffic.
- **Intrusion Detection/Prevention System (IDPS):** Review the effectiveness of the IDPS in detecting and preventing network attacks.

## Testing Methodology

### Protocols
The assessment will focus on the security of the following communication protocols:
- **TCP/IP:** Evaluate the security of TCP-based communication, including HTTP, HTTPS, and other relevant protocols.
- **UDP:** Assess the security of UDP-based communication, with a focus on specific services and applications.

### Testing Tools
The following tools will be used during the assessment:
- **Nmap:** Perform network discovery, service version detection, and vulnerability scanning.
- **Metasploit:** Test for known vulnerabilities and attempt exploitation to validate system security.
- **Wireshark:** Capture and analyze network packets for potential security issues and anomalies.
- **tcpdump:** Capture and analyze TCP/IP and UDP communication for detailed packet inspection.

### Testing Scenarios
1. **Firewall Assessment:**
   - Utilize Nmap to perform firewall scans and identify open ports.
   - Analyze firewall rules to ensure proper handling of DVWA-related traffic.

2. **Router Security:**
   - Use Nmap to scan and identify potential vulnerabilities in the router.
   - Analyze router logs using Wireshark for any suspicious activities.

3. **Switch Security:**
   - Employ Nmap for switch security scans.
   - Use tcpdump to capture and analyze switch traffic for anomalies.

4. **IDPS Effectiveness:**
   - Use Metasploit to simulate network attacks and assess IDPS responsiveness.
   - Analyze IDPS logs using Wireshark and tcpdump for detected incidents.

5. **TCP/IP Communication Assessment:**
   - Utilize Nmap for scanning and vulnerability detection on TCP-based services.
   - Use Wireshark and tcpdump to capture and analyze TCP communication for security issues.

6. **UDP Communication Assessment:**
   - Employ Nmap for scanning and vulnerability detection on UDP-based services.
   - Use Wireshark and tcpdump to capture and analyze UDP communication for security issues.

## Exclusions
The following items are explicitly excluded from the scope of this network security test:
- [List any items, systems, or components explicitly not included in the scope.]

## Rules of Engagement
- Testing will be conducted during [Specify Testing Windows].
- Coordinate with the relevant IT and security teams to minimize any potential impact on production systems.
- Ensure compliance with all relevant laws and regulations during testing.

## Reporting
A detailed report will be provided at the conclusion of the network security test, outlining findings, vulnerabilities, and recommendations for remediation.
