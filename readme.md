# Network Security 

## Objective
The primary objective of this network security test is to assess the security of the Damn Vulnerable Web Application (DVWA) with a specific focus on TCP/IP and UDP communication protocols. The assessment aims to identify and address potential vulnerabilities in the network infrastructure supporting DVWA.

## Scope Inclusions

### Target System
- **Application Under Test:** Damn Vulnerable Web Application (DVWA)
  - **Version:** 1.0.7
  - **Deployment:** [Specify deployment details, e.g., hosted on Apache server, running on Linux]

### Network Components
The assessment will cover the security of the following network components related to DVWA:
- **Firewall:** Inspect the configuration and rules governing TCP/IP and UDP traffic.
- **Router:** Assess the routing policies and controls in place.
- **Switches:** Evaluate the security of network switches handling DVWA traffic.
- **Intrusion Detection/Prevention System (IDPS):** Review the effectiveness of the IDPS in detecting and preventing network attacks.

## Testing Methodology
### Protocols
The assessment will focus on the security of the following communication protocols:

#### TCP/IP Communication
1. **HTTP (HyperText Transfer Protocol):**
   - **Scenario:** Conduct a thorough assessment of the security of HTTP communication to ensure the confidentiality and integrity of data exchanged between clients and the DVWA server. Evaluate the implementation of secure headers, such as HSTS, and assess the server's resistance to common HTTP-based attacks, including man-in-the-middle attacks and session hijacking.

2. **HTTPS (HyperText Transfer Protocol Secure):**
   - **Scenario:** Evaluate the security of HTTPS communication to ensure the secure transmission of sensitive information over the network. Verify the implementation of strong SSL/TLS configurations, check for vulnerabilities like Heartbleed, and assess the effectiveness of the server's certificate management. Test for secure renegotiation and compatibility with modern cryptographic standards.

3. **Other Relevant TCP-based Protocols:**
   - **Scenario:** Identify and assess other TCP-based protocols that are essential for DVWA functionality. This may include database communication protocols, remote administration protocols, or any custom protocols used by DVWA. Evaluate the security of these protocols for vulnerabilities, encryption strength, and proper implementation of access controls.

#### UDP Communication
1. **Custom UDP-based Services:**
   - **Scenario:** Identify and assess any custom UDP-based services that DVWA relies on for its functionality. This could include gaming services, real-time communication protocols, or any other UDP-based services. Evaluate the security of these services for potential vulnerabilities, data integrity, and resistance to common UDP-based attacks.

2. **DNS (Domain Name System):**
   - **Scenario:** Assess the security of DNS communication to ensure the integrity of name resolution and prevent DNS-related attacks. Verify the implementation of DNS security features such as DNSSEC and assess the server's resistance to DNS-based attacks, including cache poisoning and DNS tunneling.

3. **Other Relevant UDP-based Protocols:**
   - **Scenario:** Identify and assess other UDP-based protocols that play a crucial role in DVWA's network communication. This could include network discovery protocols, streaming protocols, or any custom UDP-based applications. Evaluate the security of these protocols for potential vulnerabilities and proper implementation of security controls.

### Testing Tools
The following tools will be used during the assessment:
- **Nmap:** Perform network discovery, service version detection, and vulnerability scanning.
- **Metasploit:** Test for known vulnerabilities and attempt exploitation to validate system security.
- **Wireshark:** Capture and analyze network packets for potential security issues and anomalies.
- **tcpdump:** Capture and analyze TCP/IP and UDP communication for detailed packet inspection.



### Testing Scenarios
1. **Firewall Assessment:**
   - Utilize Nmap to perform firewall scans and identify open ports.
   - Analyze firewall rules to ensure proper handling of DVWA-related traffic.

2. **Router Security:**
   - Use Nmap to scan and identify potential vulnerabilities in the router.
   - Analyze router logs using Wireshark for any suspicious activities.

3. **Switch Security:**
   - Employ Nmap for switch security scans.
   - Use tcpdump to capture and analyze switch traffic for anomalies.

4. **IDPS Effectiveness:**
   - Use Metasploit to simulate network attacks and assess IDPS responsiveness.
   - Analyze IDPS logs using Wireshark and tcpdump for detected incidents.

5. **TCP/IP Communication Assessment:**
   - Utilize Nmap for scanning and vulnerability detection on TCP-based services.
   - Use Wireshark and tcpdump to capture and analyze TCP communication for security issues.

6. **UDP Communication Assessment:**
   - Employ Nmap for scanning and vulnerability detection on UDP-based services.
   - Use Wireshark and tcpdump to capture and analyze UDP communication for security issues.
